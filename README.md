# Angel from Scratch
[Watch Tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ch73I4nUVKM)

In this (rather lengthy) tutorial, I go in depth on building an Angel application from scratch, i.e.,
without use of the Angel CLI, and without use of the default project boilerplate.

13 concepts are tackled in this video, including:
  * Routing
  * Services
  * WebSockets
  * and more...
